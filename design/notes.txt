APPS:
    - use common problems noted with existing apps and see how to use the solutions in order to design a
      better platform
    - Mail client
        Problem: all mail clients suck, despite having great ideas in places. The problem is that they all do
        many things that one does not need, and those get in the way. They also do things wrong here and there,
        and those are not configurable or replaceable (at least not easily enough). The exception is really
        simple clients, in which case the problem becomes that they lack features one needs. This features for
        all vs features for a specific user mismatch is almost universal. Add-ons can help up to a point but
        they are hard to get right, especially when they involve a lot of UI (they work well with browsers
        because most of the real estate is dedicated to the page anyway).

        Solution: a common service that implements email fetching, email sending, and mailbox management for
        the entire system. Atop that, as many UIs as one wants, interacting with it using simple APIs. You can
        write the perfect filter system, the best thread management UI, the best message viewer, a project or
        time-of-day based list of mailboxes, etc. All these components are simply autonomous web pages. The
        integration comes from a notion that is core throughout the system's UI: split screens. You can configure
        a screen to run n apps, and places those apps in clear areas of it. You can move them around and change them.
        System-wide panes exist as well, they may appear on demand.

    - things that suck
        - file system browsers
        - twitter clients
        - IRC clients
        - office suites (this can be covered by Wocuments, though)
